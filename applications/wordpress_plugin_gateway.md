## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.
We would like to build a middleware  with a WordPress plugin connecting Polkadot network with the existing internet application such as e-commerce.  We shall build a payment gateway for digital payment service provided by the third party to the eCommerce services. It authorizes direct payments, e-wallet, or credit/debit cards at online retailers, eCommerce websites or traditional physical stores. It also provides retailers with access to merchant services in order to process payments from major financial institutions. We add payment gateway methods for different infrastructure or web applications build from different open-source software such as php, ruby and java.  Polkadot has high TPS rate which can handle huge amount payments online in currently internet world. Let Polkadot payment become popular.
### Overview

WordPress (WP, WordPress.org) is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and usually paired with a MySQL or a MariaDB database as fundamental infrastructure
WordPress is already using by more than 60 million websites, including 39% of the top 10 million websites as of January 2021. WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce plugin for WordPress. A study conducted in 2017 by Todd Wilkins, Head of WooCommerce, suggested that WooCommerce stores would collectively account for nearly $10 billion in sales. We would like to add payment gateway for wordpress and woocommerce with Polkadot. It could attract huge amount of people to use Polkadot for crytocurrency payment in daily business. Nevertheless, we will not keep any information regarding merchantâ€™s private keys or money. As such, all payments processed through our Gateway is considered a completely final and fully settled.
